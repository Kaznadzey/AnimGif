TODO:

! In local testing I had a strange issue with by-frame delays: the first image eats
  up the first two delays, and is shown for the sum of those two numbers... :-o
  -> And I seem to be unable to reproduce it now! :-o

* Accept a local dir for the image list. (Do - & warn about - explicit sorting if 
  per-frame delays are specified.)

* Add an index.php frontend for demo and quickstart (synced with the example in the
  README.md, AND ALSO THE ONE AT SO!), with saving a test gif file and scandir("img/") 
  etc.

* To avoid unwanted "in-band" PHP output, I should probably disable display_errors()
  in the whole module (restoring it on normal exit).
