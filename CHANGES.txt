TODO:

* Add an index.php frontend for demo and quickstart (synced with the example in the
README.md, AND ALSO THE ONE AT SO!), with saving a test gif file and scandir("img/") 
etc.

* Allow less delay values than frames (repeating the last one).

* To avoid unwanted "in-band" PHP output, I should probably disable display_errors()
in the whole module (restoring it on normal exit).
